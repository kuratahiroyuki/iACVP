# iACVP
This package is used for prediction of anti-coronavirus peptides (ACVPs).

# Environment
 >anaconda 4.11.0  
 >python 3.8.8  
 >pytorch 1.9.0  
 >scikit-learn 1.0.2  
 >gensim 4.0.1
  
# Execution
# 1 Setting current path  
 Users need to change the program_path according to their system in the following programs.  
 In our case, we set program_path=/home/kurata/myproject/py3/ACVP_predictor.  
 >dataconst.sh    
 >w2vconst.sh     
 >main.sh   
 >shbmain.sh   
 >analysis_net.py   
 >analysis_ml.py   
 
# 2 Construction of training and test datasets  
./  
$sh dataconst.sh  
 (train_division.py,  test_fasta.py)  
 
# 3 Word2vec model construction  
./program/w2v  
$sh w2vconst.sh  
 (word2vec_acvp.py)  
 
**NOTE**  
 Use epochs=20  for prediction of AVPs  
 Use epochs=4   for prediction of ACVPs
